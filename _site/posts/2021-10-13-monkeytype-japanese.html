    <h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>MonkeyType is arguably the best website for speedtyping practice on internet and bills itself as the most configurable. This view point seems almost unanimous among the speedtyping communities I have visited.</p>
<p>One of the coolest features they have is their out of the box support for many languages - they even support coding languages such as Rust.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at the time they did not support Japanese… so I went and fixed that…</p>
<hr />
<h3>The Tech Behind it</h3>
<p>This was a really a simple affair. A new “language” in MonkeyType is submitted as a list of words in a JSON file.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Miodec/monkeytype/blob/master/static/languages/japanese_hiragana.json">You can see my submission here.</a></p>
<p>Relative to the amount of work that was put in, I feel disproportionately proud of this as a pull request of mine was accepted in one of the most popular typing sites there is, used by millions around the world.</p>
<p>I thought it would be a good idea to learn useful Japanese words while learning how to touch type in Japanese Kana.</p>
<p>One complication was that MonkeyType would not work with Kanji. Japanese is comprised of three scripts; Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana. Kanji communicates meaning whereas Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic, which means that they only express sound - just like English letters. As such every word can be expressed in Hiragana only.s</p>
<p>What I did was find a list of commonly-used Japanese words and copied and pasted it into <a href="">Visual Studio Code</a> and applied a series of regex transformations on it so I could extract a list comprising of nothing but the hiragana versions of the words. Which I then added to the JSON file and submitted.</p>
<p>In addition to this I submitted a list of common-use loan words as a separate language. Loan words are Japanese words that are borrowed from other languages. </p>
<p>They are written in Katakana.</p>
<ul>
<li>オレンジジュース → “Orenji Jyushuu” → “Orange Juice”</li>
<li>テレビ → “Telebi” → “television”</li>
<li>トイレ → “Toire” → “toilet”</li>
<li>スマホ → “Sumaho” → “Smartphone”</li>
</ul>
<p>The pull request for <a href="https://github.com/Miodec/monkeytype/blob/master/static/languages/japanese_katakana.json">this was also accepted</a>.</p>
