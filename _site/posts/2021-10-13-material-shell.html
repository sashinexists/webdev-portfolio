    <h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>(Note: I write a little about Material Shell below, but I didn’t make the Shell, I made their <a href="https://material-shell.com">website</a>)</p>
<p>A shell is a user interface that we use to interact with our computers. It is called a shell because it's what we see, it's what is on the <em>outside</em>.</p>
<p>The Material Shell project is an ambitious attempt to change the way that we interface with our desktops with a focus on productivity and multitasking.</p>
<p><img src="/images/material-shell" alt="Material Shell" /></p>
<p>It does this by implementing what’s called a <em>tiling window manager</em> rather than the floating window managers we are used to. This automates the process of positioning apps on the screen. It also introduces a feature called persistence, where between sessions the apps a user was using, the windows that were open and where they were positioned, is remembered and the user can just continue where they left off.</p>
<p>The idea for Material Shell dawned from the realisation that the activities of opening apps and moving windows around were activities done very frequently and that they could be automated.</p>
<p>It is a shell for Linux that is packaged as an extension of the popular <a href="https://forty.gnome.org/">GNOME desktop environment</a>. </p>
<p>I became interested in the project because I myself was using it, and so I reached out to their community discord and asked how I could help.</p>
<p>I created their website and built to so that it looked like Material Shell itself.</p>

<h3>The Tech Behind it</h3>
<p>I built the Material Shell website using <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">NuxtJS</a> as a static site generator. This project served as an entry point into learning about <a href="">VueJS</a> and related technologies. </p>
<p>Material Shell is so named because it closely follows the <a href="https://material.io/design">Material Design</a> principles by Google.</p>
<p>To make the website look like Material Shell, I used the <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/">Vuetify</a> framework for VueJS which allowed me to easily create and use components that were consistent with the Material Design guidelines.</p>
